Write 1200-1800 words on the following: How are the concepts of civil society and social capital related to one another? Are they synonyms? Is one part of the other? Or are they different things? Which concept do you find more useful and why? Defend your answer. Your paper should have ONE overarching argument supported by ideas from the readings (make sure to cite these properly in footnotes) and your own examples. Do not summarize the readings.
